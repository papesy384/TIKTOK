# Placeholder videos for testing

Video files are **not** in the repo (too large for git). Add these files here so the feed works:

| File | Description | Source |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `placeholder-1.mp4` | Movie (Sintel) | [MDN Sintel short](https://mdn.github.io/html-examples/link-rel-preload/video/sintel-short.mp4) |
| `messi.mp4` | Leo Messi / soccer | [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/messi/) — download a clip and rename to `messi.mp4` |
| `bunny.mp4` | Big Buck Bunny | [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/mov_bbb.mp4) or [test-videos.co.uk](https://test-videos.co.uk/vids/bigbuckbunny/mp4/h264/360/Big_Buck_Bunny_360_10s_1MB.mp4) |
| `jellyfish.mp4` | Nature | [test-videos.co.uk](https://test-videos.co.uk/vids/jellyfish/mp4/h264/360/Jellyfish_360_10s_1MB.mp4) |

After cloning, run e.g. `curl -o placeholder-1.mp4 "https://mdn.github.io/..."` (or download in browser) into this folder. For production, use Cloudinary or Mux URLs in the app instead of local files.
